# KMeansClustering_CVP
This project captures live video from your webcam and applies K-Means clustering to reduce the number of colors in each frame, producing a cartoonized (posterized) effect in real time using OpenCV.

Features
Live webcam feed processing
Dynamic color quantization using K-Means (K=3)
Real-time display of cartoonized output
Adjustable brightness enhancement

How It Works
Captures video using cv2.VideoCapture
Reshapes each frame into a 2D array for clustering
Applies OpenCVâ€™s cv2.kmeans() to reduce colors
Reconstructs the image using the cluster centers
Slightly boosts brightness for a vivid look
