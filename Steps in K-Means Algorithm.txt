ðŸ”¹ Steps in K-Means Algorithm:
1.	Choose K (number of clusters).
2.	Initialize K centroids randomly.
3.	Assign each data point to the nearest centroid (based on Euclidean distance).
4.	Update centroids by calculating the mean of all points in each cluster.
5.	Repeat steps 3â€“4 until centroids stop changing (convergence).
